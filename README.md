# Interactive-Circle-Tracing-with-a-KUKA-KR5-Robot
An interactive MATLAB-based project that enables a KUKA KR5 R650 robot to trace circular paths on a spherical surface using resolved-rate inverse kinematics. A GUI allows users to specify circle location and radius while enforcing workspace and reachability constraints.
